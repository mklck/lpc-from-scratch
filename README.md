# LPC from scratch

Project for learning low-level MCU programming using LPC2136.

# Building

To build project you need:
- `ninja` build system
- ARM toolchain (builds tested with GNU toolchain)
- basic POSIX tools

`build.ninja` file is generated by `update` script.
To configure tools and compile flags, modify `etc/rules.ninja`.
Build directory can be changed by `out` environment variable,
which defaults to `out/`.

```
$ ./update
$ ninja
```

# Flashing

`ihex` file suitable for flashing by e.g. `lpc21isp`, is generated by build system.
